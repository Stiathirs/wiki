    <p>[b:Combat] is an integral part of the game. To make progress, you will need to slay monsters that get in your way.</p>
    [#:Basics]
    <p>There are two things you must keep track of to survive combat:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Health</li>
      <li>Their Health</li>
    </ul>
    <p>[i:Yeah that's it, legit.]</p>
    <p>During combat, you can take 3 different actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attack
        <ul>
          <li>Attack the monster using your current weapon.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inventory
        <ul>
          <li>Use an item to help you in combat.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Flee
        <ul>
          <li>Run away from combat.
            <ul>
              <li>This action ends your adventure immediately.</li>
              <li>You lose 1/6 of your stash if you win initiative and immediately flee, otherwise it's 1/4.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    [#:Initiative]
    <p>The one who goes first is determined by an Initiative roll.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You roll <code><span class="die">1d20</span> + (<span class="stat">Dexterity</span> / 3)</code> rounded down.</li>
      <li>The opponent rolls <code><span class="die">1d20</span> + KillStreak</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>This means that enemies will begin to quickly outroll you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    [#:Damage]
    <p>Over the course of combat, damage will be inflicted to you and your opponent. who could've guessed?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You deal <code><span class="die">WeaponDie</span> + (<span class="stat">Strength</span> / 2 - 1)</code> damage rounded down.</li>
      <li>The enemy deals <code><span class="die">1d8</span> + KillStreak</code> damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To max out the amount of damage you inflict, check out [[Weapons]], and check [[Armor]] to reduce the damage you take.</p>
